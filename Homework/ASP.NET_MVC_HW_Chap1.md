1. What year was *ASP.NET* introduced?
- The original ASP.NET was introduced in 2002.

2. Briefly describe *ASP.NET Web Forms*.
- Web Forms is one of the 3 programming models for creating ASP.NET web sites and web applications. It is a set of UI components (pages, buttons, etc) plus a stateful, object-oriented GUI programming model. 

3. Briefly describe *ASP.NET*.
- A way to host .net applications.

4. Briefly describe *.NET*.
- It is a framework that provides a programming guidelines that can be used to develop a wide range of applications–––from web to mobile to Windows-based applications. 

5. What is Representational State Transfer (REST)? This will take some independent research.
- Examination of the Internet as a stateless service of near-limitless expansion model with a simple but effective information delivery system. REST is intended to evoke an image of how a well-designed Web application behaves: a network of web pages (a virtual state-machine), where the user progresses through an application by selecting links (state transitions), resulting in the next page (representing the next state of the application) being transferred to the user and rendered for their use.

6. What is Agile Development? This will take some independent research.
- Agile software development comprises various approaches to software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customer/end user.

7. What is unit testing?
- UNIT TESTING is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software.

8. What year was ASP.NET MVC introduced?
- October 2007

9. Describe URL routing. As part of your answer, discuss the concept of “clean URLs.”
- URL routing allows you to configure an application to accept request URLs that do not map to physical files. A request URL is simply the URL a user enters into their browser to find a page on your web site. Clean URLs, also sometimes referred to as RESTful URLs, user-friendly URLs, or search engine-friendly URLs, are Uniform Resource Locators intended to improve the usability and accessibility of a website or web service by being immediately and intuitively meaningful to non-expert users. 

10. What is the relationship between Microsoft’s .NET platform and ASP.NET MVC?
- ASP.NET is a web platform. It provides a layer that sits on top of the web server which facilitates the creation of web applications and web services. ASP.NET MVC is a framework specifically for building web applications. It sits ontop of ASP.NET and uses APIs provided by ASP.NET. ASP.NET Web Forms is another framework specifically for building web applications, and the new ASP.NET Web API is a platform for building web services.

11. Chapter 1 does not discuss the MVC pattern specifically, and in a sense this entire course is an extended examination of the MVC pattern. Using an independent resource (such as Wikipedia) briefly state the responsibility of (a) the model, (b) the controller, and (c) the view.
- Model - directly manages the data, logic and rules of the application.
- View - the user interface. Any output representation of information, such as a chart or a diagram. 
- Controller - accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view. It handles any incoming URL request.
